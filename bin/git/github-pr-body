# This command can be run with `git pr-body` (set in ~/.gitconfig)

# It's purpose is simply to allow you to keep a local version of the GitHub PR
# body message. I often include todos in there, and it's handy to edit them
# locally. The command has these features:
#
# * It automatically installs Github's CLI tool if you don't have it yet.
# * It does not require authentication with GitHub's API thanks to `hub`.
# * It uses the existing PR body as a base for further updates.
# * It keeps the writing buffer in .git/ so it's automatically ignored by git.
# * It asks to push the updated body to the GitHub website.
# * It returns a link to the PR as the command finishes.
#
# Note that `hub` will be deprecated somewhere in the future. I'm assuming
# GitHub's CLI tool will be expanded with API functionality, and I will switch
# out the current API calls made with `hub` when that time comes.
