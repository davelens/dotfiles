#
# Active branch: feature-specs

#        Result: bundle exec cap production deploy BRANCH=feature-specs
#
# Active branch: feature-specs
#       Command: deploy -s
#        Result: bundle exec cap staging deploy BRANCH=feature-specs
#
# Active branch: develop
#       Command: deploy
#        Result: bundle exec cap production deploy
#
# Active branch: master
#       Command: deploy
#        Result: bundle exec cap production deploy
#
# Active branch: develop
#       Command: deploy -b develop
#        Result: bundle exec cap production deploy BRANCH=develop

# Active branch: master
#       Command: deploy -b master
#        Result: bundle exec cap production deploy BRANCH=master
