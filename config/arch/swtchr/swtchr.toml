# Modifiers like `<Ctrl>` and `<Alt>` are ignored when parsing these keybinds.
# For example, if you want to trigger on the release of the left Super key, you

# The default keymap mimics the Gnome-style `<Super>Tab` behavior.

# You can find documentation on the format of these keymap strings here:
# https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/func.accelerator_parse.html
#
# Symbols and special keys have names that you use to reference them in the
# keymap, like `Tab` or `Escape`. The C header file below contains a
# comprehensive list of them. Just look for the string that comes after
# `GDK_KEY_`.
