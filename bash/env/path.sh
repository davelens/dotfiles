# $PATH configuration
###############################################################################

# Adds all necessary directories to the PATH variable, if they exist.
#
# The order is important, as the first directory in the list will be the first
# one to be searched (and used) for binaries. The order is:
#
#   Package managers > user made bins > system bins > everything else

# About mysql@8.4: Homebrew binaries are typically installed in the Cellar/
# directory. If a package has multiple possible versions however, it will get
# symlinked into the opt/ directory (e.g. python@3, mysql@8.4, ...).
#
# We *could* load in all homebrew binaries in opt/, but that would be a LOT
# of binaries added to $PATH one by one. That can't be healthy, but here's how
# you'd do it:
#
#   $BREW_PATH/opt/*/bin
#
# Another alternative is to set up our own symlinks into our $XDG_BIN_HOME.
# This would benefit from a helper that targets a source dir and symlinks all
# executables into a target dir. But that's a lot of effort for a single tool.
#
# For now though, I add specific packages like mysql to $PATH manually.
