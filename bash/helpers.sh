# 
#  DISCLAIMER: Exporting functions in your env is considered harmful. It's what 
#  led to the Shellshock/Bashdoor family of vulnerabilities in bash < 4.3.
#  If you want to find out if your bash is vulnerable, run the following:
# 
#    env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
# 
#  You'll see the word "vulnerable" when you're at risk.
#
#  Running Bash 5+ at the time of writing should be OK. But keep in mind that 
#  exporting functions remains a security risk. Use with caution.
