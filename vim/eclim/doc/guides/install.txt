Installing / Upgrading
**********************


Requirements
============

Before beginning the installation, first confirm that you have met the
following requirements.

- Java Development Kit
  (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.html) 1.5 or greater

- Eclipse 3.7.x (Indigo) (http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.php)

- Vim 7.1.x (http://www.vim.org/download.php)

- Mac and Linux users must also have make and gcc installed.

  Minimum Vim Settings: In order for eclim to function properly, there
  is a minimum set of vim options that must be enabled in your vimrc
  file (:h vimrc).

  - set nocompatible

    Execute :h 'compatible' for more info.  You can confirm that
    compatibliity is turned off by executing the following:

    >
       :echo &compatible

    <

    Which should output '0'.

  - filetype plugin on

    Execute :h filetype-plugin-on for more info.  You can confirm that
    file type plugins are enabled by executing the following:

    >
       :filetype

    <

    Which should output 'filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON indent:ON',
    showing at least 'ON' for 'detection' and 'plugin'.

*installer*


Eclim Graphical Installer
=========================


Step 1: Download and run the installer.
---------------------------------------

Note: If you have eclipse running, please close it prior to starting the
  installation procedure.

- First download the installer:  eclim_<version>.jar (http://sourcefor
  ge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=145869)

- Next run the installer:

  >
     $ java -jar eclim_<version>.jar

  <

  Windows and OSX users should be able to simply double click on the
  jar file to start the installer.

  Note: If you are behind a proxy, you may need to run the installer like
    so (be sure to take a look at the related faq (|eclim-proxy|) as
    well):>

       $ java -Dhttp.proxyHost=my.proxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -jar eclim_<version>.jar

    <


    If your proxy requires authentication, you'll need to supply the
    -Dhttp.proxyUser and -Dhttp.proxyPassword properties as well.You
    can also try the following which may be able to use your system
    proxy settings:>

       $ java -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true -jar eclim_<version>.jar

    <


After the installer starts up, simply follow the steps in the wizard
to install the application.

Note: In some rare cases you might encounter one of the following errors:

  1. Any exception which denotes usage of gcj.

     >
        java.lang.NullPointerException
          at org.pietschy.wizard.HTMLPane.updateEditorColor(Unknown Source)
          at org.pietschy.wizard.HTMLPane.setEditorKit(Unknown Source)
          at javax.swing.JEditorPane.getEditorKit(libgcj.so.90)
          ...

     <

     Gcj (GNU Compile for Java), is not currently supported.  If you
     receive any error which references libgcj, then gcj is your
     current default jvm. So, you'll need to install a sun jvm to
     resolve the installation error.

  2. >
        java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError
          at org.formic.ant.logger.Log4jLogger.printMessage(Log4jLogger.java:51)
          ...

     <

     This is most likely caused by an incompatible version of log4j
     installed in your jave ext.dirs.  To combat this you can run the
     installer like so:

     >
        $ java -Djava.ext.dirs -jar eclim_<version>.jar

     <


Step 2: Testing the installation
--------------------------------

To test eclim you first need to start the eclim daemon.  How you start
the daemon will depend on how you intend to use eclim.

Note: More info on running the eclim daemon can be found in the eclimd
  (|eclimd|) docs.

If you plan on using eclim along with the eclipse gui, then simply
start eclipse and open the eclimd view:

   Window -> Show View -> Other -> Eclim -> eclimd

By default the eclimd view will also be auto opened when you open a
file using:

   Open With -> Vim

If you plan on using eclim without the eclipse gui, then:

- start the eclimd server.

  - Linux / Mac / BSD (and other unix based systems): To start eclimd
    from linux, simply execute the eclimd script found in your eclipse
    root directory:

    >
       $ $ECLIPSE_HOME/eclimd

    <

  - Windows: The easiest way to start eclimd in windows is to double
    click on the eclimd.bat file found in your eclipse root directory:
    %ECLIPSE_HOME%/eclimd.bat

Once you have the eclim daemon (headed or headless) running, you can
then test eclim:

- open a vim window and issue the command, |:PingEclim|.  The result
  of executing this command should be the eclim and eclipse version
  echoed to the bottom of your Vim window.  If however, you receive
  unable to connect to eclimd - connect: Connection refused, or
  something similar, then your eclimd server is not running or
  something is preventing eclim from connecting to it.  If you receive
  this or any other errors you can start by first examining the eclimd
  output to see if it gives any info as to what went wrong.  If at
  this point you are unsure how to proceed you can view the
  troubleshooting guide (|guides-troubleshoot|) or feel free to post
  your issue on the eclim user (http://groups.google.com/group/eclim-
  user) mailing list.

     Example of a successful ping:

     [image]

     Example of a failed ping:

     [image]

- Regardless of the ping result, you can also verify your vim settings
  using the command :EclimValidate.  This will check various settings
  and options and report any problems. If all is ok you will receive
  the following message:

  >
     Result: OK, required settings are valid.

  <


What's Next
===========

Now that you have eclim installed, the next step is to familiarize
yourself with at least the core set of commands that eclim provides,
all of which are found at the index of the eclim documentation (|vim-
index|).

After doing that you can then proceed to getting started guide
(|gettingstarted|).


Upgrading
=========

The upgrading procedure is the same as the installation procedure but
please be aware that the installer will remove the previous version of
eclim prior to installing the new one.  The installer will delete all
the files in the eclim eclipse plugins and the files eclim adds to
your .vim or vimfiles directory. So if you made any alterations to any
of these files, be sure to back them up prior to upgrading.


Building from source
====================

If you would like to use the bleeding edge development version of
eclim or you would like to contribute code, then you can checkout and
build eclim from source.  Instructions on doing so can be found in the
developers guide (|development-build|).

*install-automated*


Unattended (automated) install
==============================

As of eclim 1.5.6 the eclim installer supports the ability to run an
automated install without launching the installer gui.  Simply run the
installer as shown below, supplying the location of your vim files and
your eclipse install via system properties:

>

   $ java \
     -Dvim.files=$HOME/.vim \
     -Declipse.home=/opt/eclipse \
     -jar eclim_<version>.jar install

<


Please note that when using this install method, the installer will
only install eclim features whose third party dependecies are already
present in your eclipse installation.  So before installing eclim, you
must make sure that you've already installed the necessary
dependencies (for a full list of dependencies, you can reference
eclim's installer dependencies (https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/blob
/master/org.eclim.installer/build/resources/dependencies.xml) file).

On exception to this is eclim's python plugin which currently does not
rely on any eclipse features, so to enable the installation of that
plugin, just add -DfeatureList.python=true to the install command
above.

Required Properties:

- eclipse.home - The absolute path to your eclipse installation.

- vim.files (or vim.skip=true) - The absolute path to your vim files
  directory. Or if you want to omit the installation of the vim files
  (emacs-eclim users for example) you can supply -Dvim.skip=true
  instead.
