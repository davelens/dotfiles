Uninstalling
************

To uninstall eclim you can use any eclim distribution jar whose
version is 1.7.5 or greater by running it with the 'uninstaller'
argument like so:

   >

      $ java -jar eclim_<version>.jar uninstaller

   <


That will open a graphical wizard much like the install wizard which
will ask you again for the location of your vimfiles and eclipse home
where you've installed eclim and will then remove the eclim
installation accordingly.

Unattended (automated) uninstall
================================

Like the installer, the uninstaller also supports an unattended
uninstall. You just need to supply your vim files and eclipse paths as
system properties:

>

   $ java \
     -Dvim.files=$HOME/.vim \
     -Declipse.home=/opt/eclipse \
     -jar eclim_<version>.jar uninstall

<


Required Properties:

- eclipse.home - The absolute path to your eclipse installation.

- vim.files (or vim.skip=true) - The absolute path to your vim files
  directory. Or if you never installed the vim files (emacs-eclim
  users for example) you can supply -Dvim.skip=true instead.
