# Install
Run the following line in your shell:

    git clone https://github.com/davelens/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh *

## Mac OS X defaults
I use an abundant series of defaults settings. Most of these are widely recognized as optimal settings, but some might be seem odd, strange or unwanted for you. That is why it requires a separate install. If you want to give it a go, just copy-paste the line below in your shell:

	source ~/.dotfiles/osx/defaults-overwrite

# Uninstall
If you're sick of my dotfiles, you can copy-paste the following in your shell: 

	cd ~/.dotfiles && ./uninstall.sh
