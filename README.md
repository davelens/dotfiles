# Install
Run the following line in your shell:

    git clone git@github.com:davelens/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh

# Uninstall
If you're sick of my dotfiles, you can copy-paste the following in your shell:

	cd ~/.dotfiles && ./uninstall.sh

# ENV variables
The dotfiles will pick up a ```~/.env``` file and export its contents as env variables.

# Things you should change
- Your personal info in .dotfiles/gitconfig
- If you use irssi (or plan to): Your desired servers, channels, highlights and aliases in .dotfiles/irssi/config
- The take_screenshot command in .dotfiles/bash/macos uploads a screenshot to my webspace and puts the link in my clipboard. If you want to use this as well, just replace my SSH-host with your own.

# macOS defaults
I use an abundant number of macOS setting overrides. These are subjective, so some might seem odd, strange or unwanted for you. That is why it requires a separate install instruction. A big credit here should be given to [@mathiasbynens](http://github.com/mathiasbynens), as he keeps maintaining his list for every major macOS release. If you want to give it a go, just copy-paste the line below in your shell. Use at your own discretion though, there is no reset:

	source ~/.dotfiles/macos/defaults-overrides

# Vim / Neovim
In september 2019 I made the switch to Neovim with the release of 0.4. Larger files like i18n files or data logs are so much more responsive compared to stock vim. No breaking changes using my dotfiles, only a few notable differences (like the lingering search highlight, which I toggle on/off by pressing F3).

You can still use vim with the same vimrc, but the option is there to use neovim.

## Autocompletion
Vim will use YouCompleteMe (YCM), a plugin that requires a pre-compiled component. [See their installation instructions](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation) to get this sorted.

Neovim will use coc.nvim for now. I'm not completely sold on it as it seems bloated and has features currently present in ALE. The alternative will be to use [Shougo/deoplete.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) in combination with [autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim) and the solargraph LS for Ruby.

### YCM and macos < 10.10
If you're on a version of macos lower than 10.10, chances are that the YCM component failed to compile. I got this fixed with [a helpful SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29529455/missing-c-header-debug-after-updating-osx-command-line-tools-6-3#answer-29576048).

## Vim plugins
I use `vim-plug` to manage my plugins. Remember to call ```:PlugInstall``` in Vim to install all included plugins, prior to all subsequent steps here.

### vim-airline
If you're on macos and you boot up vim for the first time after the dotfiles have been installed, the `.vimrc` will attempt to download a patched `Droid Sans Mono` font that includes Powerline icons.

If your statusbar shows questionmarks instead of specific icons, you'll need to configure your terminal to use a Powerline font as the non-ASCII font.

If you don't wish to make use of the fancy powerline icons, comment out the following line in your ```.vimrc```:

```vimscript
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
```

#### iTerm2
If you're an iTerm2 user like myself, you can do this in your profile settings in the Text tab. Look for ```Use a different font for non-ASCII text``` and select the font in the dropdown.

# Tmux
## Statusline "Segments"
My tmux config now parses small bits of information to the left of the date in the status-right section. They are inspired by and/or stolen from the (now unmaintained) [tmux-powerline repo](https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline):

* Laptop battery status. Done with [richo/battery](https://github.com/richo/battery)
* Unread e-mail count. Caveats:
  * Reads user/pass from your ```.netrc```.
  * You need to configure which servers to check [here](https://github.com/davelens/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/tmux/mailcount.sh#L6).
* Current track playing in Spotify or iTunes. Taken from a StackOverflow post, can't remember which.
